`CodeChat <http://codechat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ transforms source code into a web page, allowing developers to view their program as a beautiful and descriptive document by adding headings, formatting, hyperlinks, diagrams, images, and other forms of rich content to capture the ideas and insights that naturally flow from the process of writing a program. It also provides a blank slate in which to plan ahead, by sketching out an algorithm before committing it to code or laying out a design document which can evolve as the code does. This `literate programming <http://www.literateprogramming.com/>`_ paradigm changes the way developers think by intermingling ideas with their implementation as code, dramatically improving a programmerâ€™s abilities.

.. Note that hyperlinks don't use the typical :doc: syntax here, because:

    1. This same file will be processed by reST-only tools on the GitHub and PyPI pages, so :doc: will produce errors.

    2. Pointing to the doc homepage causes GitHub and PyPI links to automatically refer users to the full documentation set, rather than the single file (this one) hosted automatically there.

.. The following includes a YouTube CodeChat playlist.




Background
==========
Put simply, literate programming (LP) is the realization that a program is a document written to and for fellow programmers, not simply a list of instructions for a computer. LP tools therefore produce a nicely-formatted document which contains the code intermixed with explanatory prose. `Donald Knuth <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth>`_ introduced literate programming using his WEB tool in his seminal `paper <http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf>`_. Per Figure 1 of this paper_, the WEB system takes a ``.w`` document as input then produces either a "tangled" source file for compilation or a "woven" document as a ``.tex`` file. The document is beautiful; the WEB source is difficult to digest (see Figure 2a-c); the source code is completely unreadable (see Figure 3). While a plethora of `tools <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming#Tools>`_ developed over the years attempt to address these problems, only one `LP-inspired <http://rant.gulbrandsen.priv.no/udoc/history>`_ variant has gained widespread acceptance: documentation generators, such as `Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.org>`_ and `JavaDoc <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html>`_, which extract documentation directly from source code, rather than extracting source code from the documentation, as WEB and most LP tools do. CodeChat addresses these LP weaknesses by producing a document directly from the code; employing human-readable markup (reStructuredText); and by supporting a GUI to make editing an LP document-program faster and easier.
