# |docname| - Info on comment delimiters for many languages

# delimiters for each supported language. This file consists of a large table

# Imports
# =======
# These are listed in the order prescribed by `PEP 8
# <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports>`_.

# Standard library

# Supported languages
# ===================
# Based on the unique name for each lexer, provide some additional information
# on comment delimiters that Pygments doesn't explicitly define. This data was
# mostly taken from the `Wikipedia page
# <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(syntax)#Comments>`_.
