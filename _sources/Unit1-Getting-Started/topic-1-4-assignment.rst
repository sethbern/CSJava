Expressions and Assignment Statements
=====================================

In this lesson, you will learn about assignment statements and expressions 
that contain math operators and variables. 

Assignment Statements
---------------------

Remember that a variable holds a value that can change or 
vary.  **Assignment statements** initialize or change the value stored 
in a variable using the assignment operator ``=``.  An assignment statement always has a 
single variable on the left hand side of the = sign. The **value of the 
expression**  on the right hand side of 
the = sign (which can contain math operators and other variables) is copied 
into the memory location of the variable on the left hand side.

.. figure:: Figures/assignment.png
    :width: 300px
    :figclass: align-center
    :alt: Assignment statement
    
    Figure 1: Assignment Statement (variable = expression)

Instead of saying equals for the ``=`` operator in an assignment statement, 
say “gets” or “is assigned” to 
remember that the variable on the left hand side gets or is assigned the value on the right. 
In the figure above, score is assigned the value of 10 times points 
(which is another variable) plus 5.

The following video by Dr. Colleen Lewis shows how variables can change values in 
memory using assignment statements.

.. youtube:: MZwIgM__5C8
    :width: 700
    :align: center


As we saw in the video, 
we can set one variable to a copy of the value of another variable like y = x;. 
This won’t change the value of the variable that you are copying from.

   Explain in your own words why the ``ErrorSwap`` program code does not swap the values stored in x and y.



|Exercise| **Check your understanding**

Swapping two variables requires a third variable to store the value of x before assigning 
x to the value of y.  The variable y then gets assigned to the temporary variable value.
In the mixed up programs below, drag the blocks to the right to put them in the right order.

.. parsonsprob:: q1_4_3

   :practice: T
   :adaptive:
   :noindent:

   The following has the correct code that uses a third variable named "temp" to swap the 
   values in x and y. 

   The code is mixed up and contains <b>one extra block</b> which is not needed 
   in a correct solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left into the correct 
   order on the right, then check your solution.  
   You will be told if any of the blocks are in the wrong order or if you need to remove 
   one or more blocks.

            assertTrue(passed);
        }


    }





Incrementing the value of a variable
------------------------------------

If you use a variable to keep score you would probably increment it 
(add one to the current value) whenever score should go up.  
You can do this by setting the variable to the current value of the 
variable plus one (score = score + 1) as shown below. The formula 
looks a little crazy in math class, but it makes sense in coding 
because the variable on the left is set to the value of the arithmetic 
expression on the right. So, the score variable is set to the 
previous value of score + 1.

Operators

	pair: operators; addition
	pair: operators; subtraction
	pair: operators; multiplication
    pair: operators; division
    pair: operators; equality
    pair: operators; inequality

Java uses the standard mathematical operators for addition (``+``), subtraction (``-``), multiplication (``*``), and division (``/``). Arithmetic expressions can be of type int or double. An arithmetic operation that uses two int values will evaluate to an int value. An arithmetic operation that uses at least one double value will evaluate to a double value.  (You may have noticed that + was also used to put text together in the input program above -- more on this when we talk about strings.)

Java uses the operator ``==`` to test if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right and ``!=`` to test if two items are not equal.   Don't get one equal sign ``=`` confused with two equal signs ``==``! They mean different things in Java. One equal sign is used to assign a value to a variable. Two equal signs are used to test a variable to see if it is a certain value and that returns true or false as you'll see below.  Use == and != only with int values and not doubles because double values are an approximation and 3.3333 will not equal 3.3334 even though they are very close.

|CodingEx| **Coding Exercise:**

        System.out.println(2 * 3);
        System.out.println(2 / 3);
        System.out.println(2 == 3);
        System.out.println(2 != 3);
      }

            assertTrue(passed);
        }
    }
   


.. note::

   When Java sees you doing integer division (or any operation with integers) it assumes you want an integer result so it throws away anything after the decimal point in the answer, essentially rounding down the answer to a whole number. If you need a double answer, you should make at least one of the values in the expression a double like 2.0.

   
With division, another thing to watch out for is dividing by 0. An attempt to divide an integer by zero will result in an **ArithmeticException** error message. Try it in one of the active code windows above.

Operators can be used to create compound expressions with more than one operator. You can either use a literal value which is a fixed value like 2, or variables in them.  When compound expressions are evaluated, **operator precedence** rules are used, so that \*, /, and % are done before + and -. However, anything in parentheses is done first. It doesn't hurt to put in extra parentheses if you are unsure as to what will be done first.

The Modulo Operator
--------------------

The percent sign operator (``%``) is the **mod (modulo)** or **remainder** operator.  The mod operator (``x % y``) returns the remainder after you divide ``x`` (first number) by ``y`` (second number) so ``5 % 2`` will return 1 since 2 goes into 5 two times with a remainder of 1.  Remember long division when you had to specify how many times one number went into another evenly and the remainder?  That remainder is what is returned by the modulo operator.

.. note::
   The result of ``x % y`` when ``x`` is smaller than ``y`` is always ``x``.  The value ``y`` can't go into ``x`` at all (goes in 0 times), since ``x`` is smaller than ``y``, so the result is just ``x``.  So if you see ``2 % 3`` the result is ``2``.

FlowCharting
--------------


Assume you have 16 pieces of pizza and 5 people.  If everyone gets the same number of slices, how many slices does each person get?  Are there any leftover pieces?  

In industry, a **flowchart** is used to describe a process through symbols and text.  
A flowchart usually does not show variable declarations, but it can show assignment statements (drawn as rectangle) and output statements (drawn as rhomboid). 

The flowchart in figure 3 shows a process to compute the fair distribution of pizza slices among a number of people. 
The process relies on integer division to determine slices per person, and the mod operator to determine remaining slices.

Storing User Input in Variables
---------------------------------

Variables are a powerful abstraction in programming because the same algorithm can be 
used with different input values saved in variables.

    Figure 4: Program input and output


A Java program can ask the user to type in one or more values.   
The Java class ``Scanner`` is used to read from
the keyboard input stream, which is referenced by ``System.in``. Normally the keyboard input is typed into a console window, but since this is running
in a browser you will type in a small textbox window displayed below the code.   The code below shows an example of prompting the user to enter a name and 
then printing a greeting. 
The code ``String name = scan.nextLine()`` 
gets the string value you enter as program input and then stores the value in a variable.  

Run the program a few times, typing in a different name. The code works for any name: 
behold, the power of variables!

   Run this program to read in a name from the input stream. 
   You can type a different name in the input window shown below the code.

   Try stepping through the code with the CodeLens tool to see how the name variable is assigned to the value read by the scanner.
   You will have to click "Hide CodeLens"  and then "Show in CodeLens" to enter a different name for input.
   ~~~~

    import java.util.Scanner;
    public class NameReader {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);  

            System.out.println("Please Enter your name: ");
            String name = scan.nextLine();
            System.out.println("Hello " + name);

        }

    }

A rhomboid (slanted rectangle) is used in a flowchart to depict data flowing into and out of a program.  
The previous flowchart in Figure 3 used a rhomboid to indicate program output.  A rhomboid is
also used to denote reading a value from the input stream.

    Figure 5: Flow Chart Reading User Input

Figure 5 contains an updated version of the pizza calculator process.  
The first two steps have been altered to initialize the pizzaSlices and numPeople variables by reading two values from the input stream.
In Java this will be done using a Scanner object and reading from System.in.

   :language: java 
   :stdin: 16 5  
   
   Complete the program based on the process shown in the Figure 5 flowchart.  
   The program should scan two integer values to initialize pizzaSlices and numPeople.  Run the program a few times to experiment with different values for input.
   What happens if you enter 0 for the number of people?  The program will bomb due to division by zero! We will see how to prevent this in a later lesson.

|CodingEx| **Coding Exercise:** 

The program below reads two integer values from the input stream and attempts to print the sum.  Unfortunately there is a problem
with the last line of code that prints the sum.  

.. activecode:: code1_4_12
   :language: java
   :autograde: unittest   
   :stdin: 5 7
   
   Run the program and look at the result. When the input is ``5`` and ``7``, the output is ``Sum is 57``. 
   Both of the ``+`` operators in the print statement are performing string concatenation.  
   While the first ``+`` operator 
   should perform string concatenation, the second ``+`` operator should perform addition.   
   You can force the second ``+`` operator to perform addition by putting the arithmetic expression in parentheses ``( num1 + num2 )``.

    import java.util.Scanner;
    public class SumInput {
        public static void main(String[] args) {

            Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

            num1= scan.nextInt();
            System.out.println("Enter second number");
            num2= scan.nextInt();
            System.out.println("Sum is " + num1 + num2);

|Groupwork| Programming Challenge : Dog Years
------------------------------------------------
    
In this programming challenge, you will calculate your age, and your pet's age 
from your birthdates, and your pet's age in dog years.   In the code below, type 
in the current year, the year you were born, the year your dog or cat was born 
(if you don't have one, make one up!) in the variables below. Then write formulas in 
assignment statements to calculate how old you are, how old your dog or cat is, and 
how old they are in dog years which is 7 times a human year.  Finally, print it all out.

Summary
-------------------

- Arithmetic expressions include expressions of type int and double.

- The arithmetic operators consist of +, -, \* , /, and % (modulo for the remainder in division).

- An arithmetic operation that uses two int values will evaluate to an int value. With integer division, any decimal part in the result will be thrown away, essentially rounding down the answer to a whole number.

- An arithmetic operation that uses at least one double value will evaluate to a double value.

- Operators can be used to construct compound expressions.

- During evaluation, operands are associated with operators according to **operator precedence** to determine how they are grouped. (\*, /, % have precedence over + and -, unless parentheses are used to group those.)

- An attempt to divide an integer by zero will result in an ArithmeticException to occur. 

- The assignment operator (=) allows a program to initialize or change the value stored in a variable.  The value of the expression on the right is stored in the variable on the left.

- During execution, expressions are evaluated to produce a single value.

- The value of an expression has a type based on the evaluation of the expression.
