Variables and Data Types
========================

In this lesson, you will learn about variables and primitive data types.

What is a Variable?
-------------------

..	index::
	single: variable

A **variable** is a name associated with a memory location in the computer.  
Computer memory can store a value and that value can change or vary.  

The following `video <https://youtu.be/pHgYlVjagmA>`_ explains what a variable is and gives a couple of real word examples of variables.

Data Types

	single: int
	single: double

	pair: variable; primitive type
	pair: variable; object type
	pair: variable; integer
	pair: variable; floating point
	pair: variable; Boolean
	pair: variable; String

There are two types of variables in Java: **primitive variables** 
that hold primitive types and **object variables** that hold a reference 
to an object of a class.  A reference is a way to find the object 
(like a UPS tracking number helps you find your package).  
The primitive types presented in this chapter are: 

-  **int** - which store integers (numbers like 3, -76, 20393) 

-  **double** - which store floating point numbers (decimal numbers like 6.3 -0.9, and 60293.93032)
    
-  **boolean** - which store Boolean values (either true or false). 

**String** is an object type and is the name of a class in Java.  
A string object has a sequence of characters enclosed in a pair of double quotes - like "Hello".  
You will learn more about ``String`` and other object types in Unit 2. 

.. note:: 

   Some languages use 0 to represent false and 1 to represent true, but Java uses the keywords ``true`` and ``false`` in boolean variables.  

A type is a set of values (a domain) and a set of operations on them. 
For example, you can do mathematical addition with ints and doubles but not with booleans and Strings.

   :feedback_a: While you could use an int, this would throw away any digits after the decimal point, so it isn't the best choice.  You might want to round up a grade based on the average (89.5 or above is an A). 
   :feedback_b: An average is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.  To keep the most amount of information this should be done with decimal numbers so use a double. 
   :feedback_c: Is an average true or false?

Declaring Variables in Java
---------------------------

..	index::
	single: bit
	single: binary digit
	single: declare
	pair: variable; declare
  
A variable allows you to store a value in a named memory location.
To create a variable, you must tell Java its data type and its name.  
Creating a variable is also called **declaring a variable**.  
The type is a keyword like int, double, or boolean, but you get to make up the 
name for the variable.  When you create a **primitive variable** Java will set aside 
enough bits in memory for that primitive type and associate that memory location 
with the variable name that you used.   


To **declare** (create) a variable, you  specify the type, leave at least one space, 
then the name for the variable and end the line with a semicolon (``;``). 
Java uses the keyword **int** for integer, **double** for a floating point 
number (a double precision number), and **boolean** for a Boolean value (true or false). 

Here is an example **declaration** of a variable called *score*  that has type *int*.

.. code-block:: java

  int score;
  
After declaring a variable, you can give it a value like below using an equals sign ``=`` followed 
by the value.  The first time a variable is assigned a value is referred to as **variable initialization**.


.. code-block:: java

  int score;
  score = 4;
  
Or you can set an initial value for the variable in the variable declaration. 
Here is an example that shows **declaring** a variable and **initializing** it all in a single statement.  

.. code-block:: java

  int score = 4;  


The equal sign here ``=`` doesn't mean the same as it does in a mathematical equation 
where it implies that the two sides are equal.  
Here it means set the value in the memory 
location associated with the variable name on the left to a *copy* of the 
value on the right. 
The line above sets the value in 
the memory location called score to 4.

.. figure:: Figures/memory.png
    :width: 150px
    :figclass: align-center
    
    Figure 1: Storing variables in memory


.. note::
    
    The equal sign ``=`` operator performs variable assignment.  ``score=4`` results in the value 4 being copied into the memory location for variable score.

   Run the following code to see what is printed. 
   Then, change the values and run it again. 

   Click the ``Show CodeLens`` button and then use the ``Next`` button to step through the 
   program one line at a time.  Stepping through a program lets you see how memory is assigned for each variable.

   ~~~~
   public class VariableAssignment
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        int score; 
        score = 4;
        System.out.println(score);
        
        double price = 23.25;
        System.out.println(price);
        
        boolean won = false;
        System.out.println(won);
        won = true;
        System.out.println(won);
        
        String name = "Jose";
        System.out.println(name);
      }
   }
        
   ====
   // should pass if/when they run code
   import static org.junit.Assert.*;
   import org.junit.*;;
   import java.io.*;

   public class RunestoneTests extends CodeTestHelper
   {
        @Test
        public void testMain() throws IOException
        {
            String output = getMethodOutput("main");
            String expect = "4\n23.25\nfalse\ntrue\nJose";
            boolean passed = getResults(expect, output, "Expected output from main", true);
            assertTrue(passed);
        }
   }


When you are printing the value of a variable, never put quotes "" around the variable 
because that will print out the variable 
name letter by letter. For example, ``System.out.println("score");`` will print out the string "score",
rather than the value "0" stored in the variable.  Normally you do not want to print out the variable name, 
but the value of the variable in memory. If you're not sure what this means, try 
putting quotes around the variables in the print statements above and see what happens.   
   
.. note::
    
    Avoid putting a variable inside quotes ("") in a print statement since that 
    would print the variable name instead of its value.

   Fill in the following: Declare in boolean variable isRaining and initialize it to true.

   -    :boolean isRaining = true;: Correct.    
        :.*: boolean isRaining = true;


Types in Memory
---------------------------

Computers store all values using **bits** (binary digits).  A **bit** can represent two values 
and we usually say that the value of a bit is either 0 or 1. When you declare a variable, 
you have to tell Java the type of the variable because Java needs to know how many 
bits to use and how to represent the value.  The 3 different primitive types
all require different number of bits.  An integer gets 32 bits of space, a double 
gets 64 bits of space and a boolean could be represented by just one bit. 

.. figure:: Figures/typesAndSpace.png
    :width: 500px
    :figclass: align-center
    
    Figure 2: Examples of variables with names and values.  Notice that the different types get a different amount of space.

String Concatenation
---------------------------

You often need to print a message that mixes text with a variable value.  You can use the **string concatenation** operator ``+`` to 
combine strings.  So ``"hi " + "there"`` will create a new String object with the
value ``"hi there"``.  If the variable **name** has a value "Jose", 
then the code ``"Hi " + name`` will create a new String object with value ``"Hi Jose"``.

            String expect = "The score is 0\nThe price is 23.25\nWon? false\nWon? true\nHi Jose";
            boolean passed = getResults(expect, output, "Expected output from main", true);
            assertTrue(passed);
        }
   }
   
If you want spaces between words and variables when printing, you must put the 
space within the quoted string.  For example, notice the space in the string "Hi " in the last print statement. If you forget to add spaces, you will get smushed output 
like "HiJose" instead of "Hi Jose".  

Also note that the variable has to be on the 
left side of the ``=`` and the value on the right.  Switching the two is 
called **assignment dyslexia**.

        }
   }   

Naming Variables
--------------------

..	index::
	pair: variable; names

While you can name your variable almost anything, there are some rules.  A variable name should start with an alphabetic character (like a, b, c, etc.) and can include letters, numbers, and underscores ``_``. It must be all one word with no spaces. 

You can't use any of the keywords or reserved words as variable names in Java (``for``, ``if``, ``class``, ``static``, ``int``, ``double``, etc).  For a complete list of keywords and reserved words see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html.  

The name of the variable should describe the data it holds.  
A name like ``score`` helps make your code easier to read. 
A name like ``x`` is not a good variable name in programming, 
because it gives no clues as to what kind of data it holds.  Do not name
your variables crazy things like ``thisIsAReallyLongName``. 
You want to make your code easy to understand, not harder.  

.. note::

    
    - Use meaningful variable names! 
    - Start variable names with a lower case letter and use camelCase. 
    - Variable names are case-sensitive and spelling sensitive! Each use of the variable in the code must match the variable name in the declaration exactly. 
    - Never put variables inside quotes (" ").

..	index::
    single: camel case
	pair: variable; naming convention
	
The convention in Java and many programming languages is to always start a variable name with a lower case letter and then uppercase the first letter of each additional word. Variable names can not include spaces so uppercasing the first letter of each additional word makes it easier to read the name.  Uppercasing the first letter of each additional word is called **camel case**. Another option is to use underscore ``_`` to separate words, but you cannot have spaces in a variable name. 


  
.. activecode:: code1_3_5
   :language: java
   :autograde: unittest   

   Java is case sensitive so ``playerScore`` and ``playerscore`` are not the same.  Run the code below to see the difference.
   ~~~~
   public class CaseSensitive
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        int playerScore = 0; // variable name using camel case
        int playerscore = 1; // this is a different variable
        System.out.println("playerScore is " + playerScore);
        System.out.println("playerscore is " + playerscore);
      }

   What is the camel case variable name for a variable that represents a shoe size?

   -    :^\s*shoeSize$: Correct.  Start with the first word in all lowercase and uppercase the first letter of each additional word
        :.*: In camel case just appended the words after each other but uppercase the first letter of each word after the 1st word

Summary
-------------------

- A **variable** is a name for a memory location where you can store a value that can change or vary.

- A variable can be declared and initialized with the following code:

.. code-block:: java

  int score; 
  double gpa = 3.5;
  
  
- **Data types** can be categorized as either primitive type (like int) or reference type (like String).
- The three primitive data types used in this course are **int** (integer numbers), **double** (decimal numbers), and **boolean** (true or false).
- Each variable has associated memory that is used to hold its value.
- The memory associated with a variable of a primitive type holds an actual primitive value.
- When a variable is declared final, its value cannot be changed once it is initialized.
