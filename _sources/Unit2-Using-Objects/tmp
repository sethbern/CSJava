For example, here is a ``Student`` class with a method signature ``public void print()`` 
which has an empty parameter list with no parameters. 
Methods are defined after the instance variables (attributes) and constructors in a class.

    Consider the following class definition.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Party
        {
            private int numInvited;
            private boolean partyCancelled;

            public Party()
            {
                numInvited = 1;
                partyCancelled = false;
            }

            public void inviteFriend()
            {
                numInvited++;
            }

            public void cancelParty()
            {
                partyCancelled = true;
            }
        }

    Assume that a Party object called myParty has been properly declared and initialized in a class other than Party.  Which of the following statements are valid?

    - myParty.cancelParty();

      + Correct!

    - myParty.inviteFriend(2);

      - The method inviteFriend() does not have any parameters.

    - myParty.endParty();

      - There is no endParty() method in the class Party.

    - myParty.numInvited++;

      - This would cause an error because you cannot access the private instance variables of an object outside of the class.

    - System.out.println( myParty.cancelParty() );

      - This would cause an error because the void method cancelParty() does not return a String that could be printed out.

    Consider the following class definition.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Cat
        {
            public void meow()
            {
                System.out.print("Meow ");
            }

            public void purr()
            {
                System.out.print("purr");
            }

            public void welcomeHome()
            {
                purr();
                meow();
            }
            /* Constructors not shown */
        }

    Which of the following code segments, if located in a method in a class other than Cat, will cause the message "Meow purr" to be printed?

    - .. code-block:: java

        Cat a = new Cat();
        Cat.meow();
        Cat.purr();

      - You must use the object a, not the class name Cat, to call these methods.

    - .. code-block:: java

        Cat a = new Cat();
        a.welcomeHome();

      - This would print "purrMeow "

    - .. code-block:: java

        Cat a = new Cat();
        a.meow();
        a.purr();

      + Correct!

    - .. code-block:: java

         Cat a = new Cat().welcomeHome();

      - This would cause a syntax error.

    - .. code-block:: java

         Cat a = new Cat();
         a.meow();

      - This would just print "Meow ".

  
like below. Notice that the **return statement** in a method returns the value that is indicated in the return type back to the calling method. The calling method must save or use or print that value.

        Liquid water = new Liquid();

        System.out.println(water.getTemp());

    What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
    
    - \-10
    
      - The Liquid() constructor sets the currentTemp instance variable to 50 and the lowerTemp() method subtracts 10 from it. 
    
    - 50
    
      - The Liquid() constructor sets the currentTemp instance variable to 50 and the lowerTemp() method subtracts 10 from it.
