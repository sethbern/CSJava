    <b>Gym Membership Discount</b>
    <br>
    A gym offers discounts on membership fees based on age and frequency of visits per week. The parameter <code>age</code> is the person's age in years, and <code>visitsPerWeek</code> is the average number of visits per week. The result is the discount percentage encoded as an int. The conditions are:
    <ul>
    <li>If the person is 60 years old or older and visits the gym 3 times or more per week, they get a 30% discount.</li>
    <li>If the person is less than 60 years old and visits the gym 5 times or more per week, they get a 15% discount.</li>
    <li>If neither condition is met, and the person is between 18 and 25 years old (inclusive), they get a 5% discount.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, there is no discount.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Lucky Number</b>
    <br>
    An old witch told us a person's lucky number is determined based on the date and time of their birth. The parameters are <code>day</code> and <code>hour</code>. The <code>day</code> is the day of birth (from 1 to 31), and the <code>hour</code> is the hour of birth (from 0 to 23). According to her, the lucky number is calculated as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>If the day is even and the hour is greater than 12, the lucky number is the sum of the day and the hour.</li>
    <li>If the day is even and the hour is less or equal than 12, the lucky number is the product of the day and the hour.</li>
    <li>If the day is odd and the hour is greater than 10, the lucky number is the hour minus the day.</li>
    <li>If the day is odd and the hour is less or equal than 10, the lucky number is the day minus the hour.</li>
    </ul>
    Select the correct code for this problem.

      <b> Apartment Cleaning </b>

   You and your roommate are deciding whether to clean the apartment. The parameter ``yourMessiness`` represents how messy your side of the apartment is, and ``roommateMessiness`` represents how messy your roommate's side is, both in the range from 0 to 20. The result is an ``int`` value indicating whether it's time to clean. Return:
    * If either messiness is 5 or less (i.e., it's still relatively clean), return 0 (no need to clean);
    * With the exception that if either messiness is 18 or more (i.e. the apartment is very messy), return 2 (definitely needs to clean);
    * Otherwise, return 1 (maybe).
